Student Astronaut Project</font></a><font size="4"><br>
</font>Photoshop<br>
<font size="2">A semester project, students create a cartoon version of their 
head, build an entire solar system (complete with stars, nebula, sun, planets, 
comet, and asteroids), and create an animation of their head in a cartoon 
spaceship flying thru the solar system.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://dokilen.github.io/photopea/"><font size="4">
Student Astronaut Project</font></a><font size="4"><br>
</font>Photopea<br>
<font size="2">Same as the above project, but directions are written for 
Photopea.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2">PLEASE NOTE that enough of these Astronaut 
Projects exist on the Internet that students may find one of the images and 
attempt to pass it off as their own.<br>
ALWAYS require students to turn in the psd file with all layers included!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><a href="https://dokilen.github.io/a_new_me/">A 
New Me</a><br>
</font>Photopea<br>
<font size="2">Students take a headshot of themselves and replace various facial 
features (eyes, ears, nose, mouth, hair) with facial features from famous 
people.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://dokilen.github.io/alien"><font size="4">Alien</font></a><font size="4"><br>
</font>Photopea<br>
<font size="2">All students turn a headshot into an alien, and then students 
turn themselves into a large headed, green skinned alien with a tail.<br>
</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://dokilen.github.io/remove"><font size="4">Removing Objects</font></a><font size="4"><br>
</font>Photopea<br>
<font size="2">Covers seven different methods to remove objects from a static 
image. Includes individual extension activity where students select a panoramic 
image and remove the people from it.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2">For the exercise at the end, if may be helpful 
to assignment images to individual students. This will avoid them selecting an 
image to edit that is beyond their skill set.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2">Please note that in an effort to avoid students 
simply downloading the image on Step 1 without the people and turning that in, 
that I have incorporated several edits to the image that will let you know that 
students did not complete the work.<br>
<img border="0" src="06_1.jpg" width="435" height="374"><br>
On the yellow/orange building on the left I have included a balcony that is not 
in the original image.<br>
The shadow on the right has been decreased.<br>
The copyright in the image they are supposed to download and use during the 
tutorial does not reach the light colored building.<br>
This image is smaller than the full-sized image (this one is 250x216).<br>
Finally, a large part of both the top and bottom of the full-sized image have 
been cropped off.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2">I hate that students try to cheat on this 
project, but I have had students attempt to pass off this image as their own 
before. I've even had students claim they resized it, cropped it, and removed 
the copyright notice and shadow. But when you ask them what other changes they 
made, the yellow/orange building always catches them.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2">Also, you may have some students who find it 
easier to remove the watermark on the final image at the bottom of Step 9 and 
try to turn that in. If that happens, please note that while the copyright 
notice is the same as the one from the image that they should have used during 
the tutorial, that the yellow/orange building, the shadow, and the crop have all 
been adjusted for this image as well.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2">Just tell them not to cheat.<br>
</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://dokilen.github.io/giant/"><font size="4">Creating a Giant</font></a><font size="4"><br>
</font>Photopea<br>
<font size="2">All students turn a guy pushing a car into a giant pushing down a 
building. Individual extension activity has students creating an image with 
themselves as the giant.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2">If you have students who are already familiar 
with working in Photoshop/Photopea or who complete this assignment quickly, I 
recommend assigning them a background image where they have to put themselves in 
water. This will force them to add in ripples and a reflection. The exercise 
page does mention images with water, but per the instructions they are not 
required to select one. Assigning them a water image will increase their work 
time.</font></p>
